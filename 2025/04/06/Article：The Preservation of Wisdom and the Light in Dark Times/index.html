<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Recently, I received some unexpected and rather disheartening news. A dear friend of mine, known in the digital world as answer77, has decided to pause updates on his blog. Yes, he deleted the database and fled！This decision came as a shock to me, and I couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of loss. I reached out to him, expressing my concern: “If you stop updating, your knowledge and wisdom will not be passed on. They will be lost to the annals of human history.” His response was simple yet profound: “I’ve deleted them all.”</p>
<p>Even though I know that for him, rebuilding a website would only take a few hours, if not less. But now I can’t see his articles anymore! Wait, maybe one article is still preserved, you know. Fortunately, before this decision, I had the foresight to ask for his permission to archive the markdown documents he had shared with me. With his consent, I uploaded the document to my own website, ensuring that his invaluable insights would not be lost to time.

<h2 id="The-Importance-of-Preserving-Wisdom"><a href="#The-Importance-of-Preserving-Wisdom" class="headerlink" title="The Importance of Preserving Wisdom"></a>The Importance of Preserving Wisdom</h2><p>In an age where information is abundant yet often fleeting, the preservation of knowledge and wisdom is more crucial than ever. My friend’s blog was not just a collection of thoughts and ideas; it was a repository of human intellect and experience. The cessation of its updates felt like a small but significant loss to the collective human consciousness.</p>
<p>However, this incident has reminded me of the importance of preserving such treasures. It is not just about maintaining a digital archive; it is about ensuring that the wisdom of individuals does not disappear into oblivion. It is about recognizing that each person’s contribution to the world of ideas is valuable and deserves to be remembered.</p>
<p>Right now, I just hope that ‘that person’ doesn’t delete the database and run away. Every time I hear news about someone deleting a website project, I feel incredibly shocked and saddened. Even though I understand that for a skilled technician, rebuilding a website might only take a few hours, or even less, the real issue is—what about those precious articles and data? These are irreplaceable.<br> <br>I understand that the pressure and challenges faced by technicians are immense, and sometimes they might feel that deleting everything and leaving is a way to find relief. However, for those of us who rely on this data, it is undoubtedly a tremendous loss.
 </p>
<h2 id="The-Light-in-Dark-Times"><a href="#The-Light-in-Dark-Times" class="headerlink" title="The Light in Dark Times"></a>The Light in Dark Times</h2><p>Beyond the intellectual loss, my friend’s blog held a special place in my heart because it was a source of inspiration and strength during my lowest moments. In times of personal struggle, the words and ideas shared by my friends, particularly lys and 77, were like beacons of light guiding me through the darkness.<br>Their blogs were filled with sentences that sparkled with human resilience and passion. These were not just words; they were lifelines that helped me hold on when everything seemed hopeless. The courage and determination reflected in their writings were contagious, and they played a crucial role in my journey towards recovery and self-discovery.
 </p>
<h2 id="A-Tribute-to-My-Friends"><a href="#A-Tribute-to-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="A Tribute to My Friends"></a>A Tribute to My Friends</h2><p>I owe a great debt to my friends, especially lys and 77, for their unwavering support and the wisdom they have shared. Their blogs were more than just online journals; they were sanctuaries of hope and inspiration. The fact that I could access their thoughts and ideas, even in the depths of my despair, was a testament to the power of their words.</p>
<p>In a world that often feels overwhelming and chaotic, the presence of such individuals is a reminder that there is still goodness and brilliance to be found. Their willingness to share their knowledge and experiences has enriched my life in countless ways, and I am eternally grateful for their generosity.</p>
<h2 id="A-Special-Thanks-to-lys"><a href="#A-Special-Thanks-to-lys" class="headerlink" title="A Special Thanks to lys"></a>A Special Thanks to lys</h2><p>I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lys2021.com/">lys</a> for consistently updating their blog with a wealth of valuable knowledge. Their dedication to sharing insightful and informative content has greatly contributed to my own learning and growth. Thanks to their efforts, I have been able to expand my horizons and deepen my understanding of various subjects. lys’s blog has been an invaluable resource, and I am truly grateful for their commitment to educating and inspiring others.</p>
<h2 id="A-Heartfelt-Thanks-to-All-My-Friends"><a href="#A-Heartfelt-Thanks-to-All-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="A Heartfelt Thanks to All My Friends"></a>A Heartfelt Thanks to All My Friends</h2><p>In addition to lys, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to all my friends who have shared their thoughts, dreams, and passions through their blogs. Their ambition, courage, enthusiasm, and fervor have not only inspired me but have also illuminated the world around us. Their relentless pursuit of knowledge and their willingness to share their journeys have been a source of light and motivation. While I cannot elaborate on each of their contributions due to space constraints, I want to acknowledge the profound impact they have had on my life and the lives of many others.</p>
<h2 id="Golden-Words-to-Ponder-A-Message-for-All"><a href="#Golden-Words-to-Ponder-A-Message-for-All" class="headerlink" title="Golden Words to Ponder: A Message for All"></a>Golden Words to Ponder: A Message for All</h2><p> <br>“The greatest merit of a person lies in their ability to soothe and reassure others, while the greatest sin is to destroy the hearts of people. Those who dwell in the light do so because they understand the darkness intimately and choose to uphold the light. Just as towering trees grow strong by deeply rooting themselves in the darkness, so too do they thrive. Those who are in the light should radiate a warmth that comforts others, becoming a beacon of hope in the darkness. This is a meritorious act. Those who find themselves in the dark should live vibrantly, not being trapped by the worldly notions of winning and losing, but instead living with ease, grace, and freedom.” -JiangnanPsalter</p>
<p>I firmly believe that we are <code>all</code> destined for a <code>bright</code> and <code>promising future</code>.</p>
<p>By the way, many of you may have noticed that my domain has changed. This is because “Less is more”, and I decided to adopt a simpler way to maintain my website (although with GitHub, there’s hardly any maintenance needed, ROFL). Thanks to GitHub for their support.<br>Well, since the domain has changed, many people might have trouble finding my new site. Only the clever hackers or programmers will be able to locate this website now.</p>
